# Cie Hervé KOUBI: The Barbarian Nights

Hello All! French tricker/dancer/acrobat [@mpowerthe1](https://www.instagram.com/mpowerthe1/) has invited us to his show playing at UW this weekend! Anyone else thinking Saturday maybe after a beach day?

### About the [Show](https://meanycenter.org/tickets/2024-05/production/cie-herve-koubi): 
>Drawing creative strength from his Algerian roots and Mediterranean culture, choreographer Hervé Koubi makes a much-anticipated return to Seattle with his exceptional all-male dance troupe.  Combining contemporary and urban dance movements with capoeira and martial arts, this powerful company is known for its arresting imagery and gravity-defying choreography.  In the critically acclaimed Les Nuits Barbares (The Barbarian Nights), Koubi takes a deep look into the history of the Mediterranean to extract the truth behind the stereotypes of those who were once considered "barbarians."

### Review:
>A dazzling blend of gymnastics, modern dance, capoeira, break dancing, and ballet, the work is a feast for the eyes.
