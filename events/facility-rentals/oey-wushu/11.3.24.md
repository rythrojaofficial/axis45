> Hi Oey,
> How do you think yesterday went?

I think I understand what you're trying to do here. There are only two possible ways for me to interpret the situtation:

1. You must think that both Krissy and I are _fucking idiots_ OR
2. You yourself are such a _fucking idiot_ that you did stop for one second to even consider how _fucking irresponsible, dangerous, AND idiotic_ your actions were.

## Ripping a new one

Consider the following questions:

    > In the process of learning a backflip in a class setting, how many times should falling on your head be considered acceptable?

    > In the process of teaching a backflip, how many times should the student falling on their head be considered acceptable?

    > In the process of spotting a backflip, how many times should the student falling on their head be considered acceptable?

    > In the process of teaching a class to backflip, how many instances of students falling on their heads be considered acceptable?

If your answer is anything other than **zero** times, you need to have your head examined and your coaching credentials tossed into an active volcano because you are an active threat to the health, safety, and lives of those you are attempting to teach.

    Being able to backflip is not a meaningful prerequisite to teaching a student a backflip.

Let that sink into your pea brain. Now read it again.

     Being able to backflip is not a meaningful prerequisite to teaching a student a backflip

You probably won't have any interest in teaching a backflip if you can't do it, AND YET, I would NOT list being able to backflip (even exceptionally) as a meaningful credential to teaching a backflip

### Meaningful Prerequisites to Teaching a Backflip

1. Experience in understanding what potential _risks_ are present in learning to flip
   1. Nervous System: Neck/Spine/Nerve
      1. paralysis, death.
   1. Brain: Concussion
   1. Musculoskeletal:
      1. Ankle/Wrist/Elbow/Knee/shoulder
   1. Mental:
      1. Mental blocks happen **super quickly** if you badly bail a flip, and can set back the learning process 3-6 months.
1. Experience in understanding when the student is ready for any given step
   1. But **especially** when they are ready to flip for the **first time** and for the **first time alone**
1. Experience in understanding what the timeline for someone learning to flip on the floor
   1. 1 day, _if_
      1. the student is super athletic in the right ways, durable, and the right kind of stupid.
      1. if you think this is more than 1/10 high performing ATHLETES, you are going to get a lot of people hurt
   1. a few weeks of practice, visualization, and spotting _if_
      1. the student is athletic in the right ways, decently durable, and risk tolerant
      1. Most highly capable, risk tolerant athletes should not be fliping until the 3rd or 4th lesson without exetensive prior experience.
   1. 4-6 months of consistent practice drills, visualization, exercise, and spotting _if_
      1. the student is minorly lacking in one or two or of the following categories: athleticism, durability, risk tolerance; OR is a one day or few weeks type of student who lands on their head and gets a mental block
   1. 1 year of consistent practice drills, exercise, visualization, and spotting _if_
      1. the student is majorly lacking in one of the following categories or minorly lacking in many of the categories.
   1. If they could not make significant progress within 1 year of consistent work, either they really aren't cut out for it or the coach hasn't addressed one of the key components.
1. Experience in a methodology for critical elements of the skill
   1. jump/takeoff/set
   2. rotation as a concept
   3. the landing
   4. simulate putting it together
1. Experience in drills and cues for the above
1. Experience in spotting methodologies through several phases
   1. first flip
   1. 2nd-5th flip
   1. 5th - 20th flip
   1. for confidence
1. Experience in saving a student when a bail occurs
   1. when to cancel
   1. when to toss over
1. Experience in understanding the potential & the shortcomings of any given piece of gym equipments
   1. what are the pros and cons of mats, pits, trampolines, airtracks, blocks, spotting belts, etc
1. Caring about the health, safety, and lives of those you are teaching.

## and you

It would be gross negligence, if not far worse, to allow you to continue to "coach" students within our facility in any capacity in your current state, unsupervised.
