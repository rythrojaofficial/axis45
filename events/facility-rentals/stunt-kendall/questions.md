> As stated, I'm a stunt performer and actor looking to hold a weapons performance workshop in the Seattle area (I'm connected to a few performers there via the Stunt Fight Club group). For specs, I was thinking a 2-3 hour class in late Sept / early Oct, with a max of about 20 people.

Hi Kendall,

Thanks for reaching out, and Jonah for connecting. Your workshop is something we are potentially interested in hosting. Before we can say for sure, we have some questions below for clarification. Should we proceed, we'll draw up a contract based on the specifics.

### Participants

20 is nearing the upper limit of what we're comfortable with in the space. Ideally 15 participants to leave space for you and helpers and myself+helpers just in case.

1. Is a 16 participant limit a dealbreaker for you?

### Weapons

What's the weapons situation? We need to ensure that all weapons entering the space will be appropriate props and NOT real weapons.

1.  What kind of weapons will be used?
1.  Will weapons be provided?
1.  Will people be allowed to bring their own weapons?
    1. This seems difficult to control . . .

### Curriculum

Tell us more about the workshop and your experience. We want to ensure a safe and effective curriculum.

1. What is the scope of the workshop as far as experience level?
1. Are you able to give a general overview/lesson plan?
1. Will there be stunt falling?
1. Can you speak to your experience
   1. In performing
   1. In teaching
      1. Have you done this workshop before? Or others like it?
      1. Are you cpr/first aid certified?
         1. If not, are you able to have someone on hand for that?

### Pricing and Payment

What are your pricing expectations? We want to ensure it makes sense for both of us economically.

1. What will be the advertised price?
2. Facility Rental fee
   1. What do you think is a fair fee:
      1. Assuming a flat rate
      2. Assuming a per person rate
3. How do you plan to collect payment from your participants?

### Responsible Party

The **"responsible party"** will be the person who signs the contract and is responsible for all of the below mentioned tasks.

1. Ensure that everyone has read/signed the waiver and understands the rules
1. Ensure that everyone is abiding by the parking stipulations
1. Tally/keep track of participants and registration
   1. Will you be able to do a pre-registration?
1. Collect and distribute payment
   1. We do not plan to be involved in collecting payments from participants. We prefer to have one card saved on file to charge the downpayment before and the rest after.

Are you willing to be the responsible party?
-If not, are you able to have someone on hand for that?

### Scheduling

1. Saturday/Sunday are the preferred days on our end. Do either of them work for you?
   1. Do you have a preference?
   1. Do you prefer mid-morning, noon, mid-Afternoon, or Evenings
