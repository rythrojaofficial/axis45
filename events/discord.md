## Notifications Settings

We're not always interested in _everything_ going on. That's one of the main reasons we're using discord!

By [default](#ðŸ“¢-strictly-updates-default), you will only get important @mentions for news and updates and no chat notifications.

Navigate below if you want to change your notification settings!

| [ðŸ™… No Notifications: Mute Server](#ðŸ™…-no-notifications-mute-server)                      | [ðŸ™† Enable All Chats](#enable-chats)   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [Enable Certain Chats or Categories](#updates-and-certain-chats-only-mentions--overrides) | [Muting Certain Chats or Categories]() |

<blockquote>

### ðŸ™… No Notifications: Mute Server

_if you do not want news, updates, or chat notifications._

1. Once in our server, tap the **Seattle Tricking Community** at the top for server settings
2. tap **Notifications** near the top for notification settings
3. tap **Mute Seattle Tricking Community** "until I turn it back on"

_Optionally you can mute the server for 15m-24hrs if you're just busy!_

You can always check updates and public chats, you just won't get any push notifications.

2. tap **Notifications** near the top for notification settings
3. under **Server Notifications Settings** tap **only @mentions**
