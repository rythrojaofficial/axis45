## Notifications Settings

You may be interested in _everything_ going on. But we're guessing not! That's one of the main reasons we're using discord!

By [default](#enable-chats), you will get all chat notifications.

Navigate below to fine tune your notification settings!

1. ðŸ™… No Notifications: Mute Server
2. Mute certain Channels or Categories as you go
3. ðŸ“¢ Updates Only with Option for Chat Notifications
4. Enable Chats : Default + Option to Mute ahead of time

<blockquote>

### ðŸ™… No Notifications: Mute Server

_if you do not want news, updates, or chat notifications._

1. Once in our server, tap the **Seattle Tricking Community** at the top for server settings
2. tap **Notifications** near the top for notification settings
3. tap **Mute Seattle Tricking Community**
   - "until I turn it back on"

_Optionally you can mute the server for 15m-24hrs if you're just busy!_

You can always check updates and public chats, you just won't get any push notifications.
