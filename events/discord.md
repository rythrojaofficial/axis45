## Notifications Settings

You may be interested in _everything_ going on. But we're guessing not! That's one of the main reasons we're using discord!

By [default](#enable-chats), you will get all chat notifications.

Navigate below to fine tune your notification settings!

<blockquote>

### ðŸ™… No Notifications: Mute Server

_if you do not want news, updates, or chat notifications._

1. Once in our server, tap the **Seattle Tricking Community** at the top for server settings
2. tap **Notifications** near the top for notification settings
3. tap **Mute Seattle Tricking Community**
   - "until I turn it back on"

_Optionally you can mute the server for 15m-24hrs if you're just busy!_

You can always check updates and public chats, you just won't get any push notifications.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

### Mute certain Channels or Categories

_if a chat is blowing up that you don't need to be part of at the moment, OR if you know you don't want to be part of a channel or category_

1. Once in our server, long tap (or right click) a category or channel you don't want to get notifications for
1. tap the **mute bell**
1. if it's just for 15m, an hour, etc, tap your option

if you never want those notifications, tap **Until I turn it back on**

2. tap **Notifications** near the top for notification settings
