  - don't forget to hop down from the booth every now and then to hit some tricks!

## What is Tricking

- In 3 words, Tricking is **Acrobatic Martial Arts**. but i'm up here with a mic so you get more than 3:
- Tricking is an **Artistic Discipline** that explores acrobatic movement through elements incorporated from Martial Arts, Tumbling, and Dance
- Let's break it down:
  - **explores acrobatic movement** through elements incorporated from Martial Arts, Tumbling, and Dance
    - We're exploring movement
    - we're integrating ideas, movements, shapes, transitions
    - we incorporate, integrate, modify, mold these and reimagine these into our own tricking.
  - tricking is an artistic discipline
    - Trickers, we want to see your compositions: your choices, rhthyms, rhymes, and chords. Simply composing combos in itself could be an art.
    - but then we get to bring those ideas floating in their head to life!
      - you could have 2 trickers do the exact same combo on paper, and have it look completely diffent.
      - Tricking brings out everyone's background.
      - if you're naturally stronger than you are flexible, we'll see it
      - Or if you're naturally more flexible than you are strong, we'll see it
      - If you did martial arts: tkd, wushu, capoeira? we'll see it.
      - if you did tumbling, breaking, ballet, ANYTHING, we'll see it.
    - what i'm saying is that we want to see you through your tricking. and that artistic expression to me is my favorite part about tricking.

## Classes

- Tuesday Guided Tricking
  - Did y'all know we're here on Tuesdays?
  - It used to be beginner friendly tricking but everyone that comes to that got too good so now it's intermediate guided tricking.
  - We also do tricking exercise after that
    - plyos, explosive stuff, killer abs and lately handstand things
    - you know everything trickers know to do, but have a hard time sticking to routine on.
- Thursday Tricking Foundations
  - For anyone out there that kind of does tricks, but maybe doesn't fully do tricking yet
  - Tricking foundations is a 4 week introductory course that teaches the basic tricks yes
  - but more importantly, it covers basic tricking transistions, which unlocks combo potential and just makes tricking a lot more fun in general
  - afterwards we have a separate flipping progressions class for anyone interested in learning flips.
  - if you have anyone looking to start either tricking or flipping or both, make sure to let them know thursday evenings are it!
- Sunday Stretch and Break
  - Sundays we do a long form stretch, ~ 1andahalf-2 hrs of stretch.
  - we all know we gotta be stretching but lets be real
  - we'll stretch when we get home, but then . . .
