## Not a Gathering Greeting

- Hello and welcome to Not a gathering (2)!
  - thanks everyone for coming out today
  -
- DJ
  - Did y'all say hi to DJ Slava in the booth?
  - did you know it was Slava's birthday last week?
  - everybody ask him how old he is
  - Slava's been taking classes with us since the SANCA days
  - don't forget to hop down from the booth every now and then to hit some tricks!

## What is Tricking

- In 3 words, Tricking is **Acrobatic Martial Arts**, with emphasis on the arts. If you want more than 3 we could say:
- Tricking is an **Artistic Discipline** that explores acrobatic movement through elements incorporated from Martial Arts, Tumbling, and Dance
- breaking it down further:
  - **explores acrobatic movement** through elements incorporated from Martial Arts, Tumbling, and Dance
    - We're exploring movement
    - we're integrating ideas, movements, shapes, transitions
    - we incorporate, integrate, modify, and reimagine these into our own tricking.
  - tricking is an artistic discipline
    - Trickers, we want to see your compositions: your choices, rhthyms, rhymes, and chords. Simply choosing what to incorporate is an art in itself.
    - but then we get to bring those ideas to life!
      - you could have 2 trickers do the exact same combo on paper, and have it look completely diffent.
      - Tricking brings out everyone's background.
      - if you're naturally stronger than you are flexible, we'll see it
      - Or if you're naturally more flexible than you are strong, we'll see it
      - If you did martial arts: tkd, wushu, capoeira? we'll see it.
      - if you did tumbling, breaking, ballet, ANYTHING, we will see it.
    - what i'm saying is that we want to see you through your tricking. and that artistic expression to me is my favorite part about tricking.

## Classes

- Tuesday Guided Tricking
  - Did y'all know we're here on Tuesdays?
  - It used to be beginner friendly tricking but everyone that comes to that got too good so now it's intermediate guided tricking.
  - We also do tricking exercise after that
    - plyos, explosive stuff, killer abs and lately handstand things
    - you know everything trickers know to do, but have a hard time sticking to routine on.
- Sunday Stretch and Break
  - Sundays we do a long form stretch, ~ 1andahalf-2 hrs of stretch.
  - we all know we gotta be stretching but lets be real
  - we'll stretch when we get home, but then . . .

## Learn flips

- If you know someone that wants to learn tricking, and/or flipping or you yourself are wanting to learn tricking and/or flipping:
  - We've got the classes for you on Thursday evenings
  - We start a 4 week cycle of tricking foundations on the first Thursday of every month (that is next week thursday at 6:30pm)
    - tricking foundations is tricking 101. No experience is required (just be moderately healthy and be able to run and jump). Even if you come from a flipping or martial arts background, learning the tricking-specific shapes, setups, takeoffs, positions, and how they're all connected can take you from a person that does tricks to a tricker.
  - If the whole tricking thing seems a bit complicated and you just want to learn to flip, that class is right after tricking foundations at 7:30pm
    - we do everything you need to safely learn frontflip, backflip, and sideflip
  - If you or someone you know are interested in tricking and/or flipping, registration is open for the september session starting next thursday at 6:30pm

## Empower

- Have you said hi to Gina over in the corner?
- Gina is a Doctor of Physical therapy and the owner of Empower Manual Therapy on our wall. Her clinic is down the road in shoreline.
- She's been taking care of us basically since we started.
- Gina, do you have words for the Not a Gathering folk?
