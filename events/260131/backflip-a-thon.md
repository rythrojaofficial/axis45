## Axis 45's Backflip-a-Thon Fundraiser

Seattle Tricking's Axis 45 is hosting a Backflip-a-Thon to raise funds for upcoming lease negotiations.

Our evil landlords have materialized 8k worth of fees bogus fees and are putting pressure on us to accept unfavorable lease terms if we can't pay a good portion of that immediately.

You can support our goal by pledging a certain dollar amount per backflip from the group OR per backflip from a specific member.

### Quest to 1,000 Backflips

- Axis members will be **collecting pledges** for a certain dollar amount **per flip performed** by
    - either the group total, a specific person's total, or both
    - through the form below

- Each member will have 20 minutes to contribute as many backflips as they can to the total.  

- Most members will be aiming to complete between 50-100 flips within the time frame.

### Why a Fundraiser?
Our time in our current space is almost up and we are in the thick of a heated lease renegotiation.

Our evil landlords decided that this would be their best opportunity to make a buck and have somehow materialized $8k+ worth of fees out of thin air after increasing our monthly rent by $500/month without warning.  They hope to make us accept worse terms for the lease extension if we can't pay a decent portion even if we're disputing their claims to that amount.

Axis 45 is a sacred space, a home away from home. The funds from our backflip-a-thon will either help get us through the renegotiation or allow us to relocate. Please help us to continue serving the community we've built.
