## Why are there workshops in December?

Tricking Foundations class operates on 4-week cycles that builds upon itself. That's extra tricky to do in December where the last week starts with Christmas and ends with New Year.

Instead, we'll have 3 separate 1hr workshops on those Thursdays! _7:30pm Flipping Progressions class_ will be happening as usual
