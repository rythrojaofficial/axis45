# Beginner-Intermediate Raiz Workshop

<!-- run + warm up 10m -->

### This style of Raiz

- circular, as opposed to linear
- horizontal as opposed to fully inverted
- most purely raiz feel
  - translates well to pivot, frontswing, and regular "cheat" step
- Looks good on its own
- "Every Trick is a Raiz"
- Accessible
  - Can be done with very low effort
  - More reps, less strain
