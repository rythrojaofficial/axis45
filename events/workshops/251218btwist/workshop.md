## Relationship between Bkick and Btwist
### similarities:
1. flipping rotation (flatspin)
    1. they should both flatspin (like a frisbee) 180degrees (halfway around)
1. timing and takeoff
    1. butterfly kick has a kick kick timing. butterfly twist has the same 2 part timing when done well. 
    1. crucial to be familiar with the timing.  
        1. beginners will use only the first timing to do everything
        1. more advanced twisters will use the first kick timing for the first half spin and the second kick timing for the second half spin
### differences:
1. twisting rotation 
    1. twisting here refers to spinning (like a rotisserie chicken)
    1. bkick has no spinning rotation, and btwist has 360degrees (one full rotation) of twist
1. landing position
    1. bkick lands on your the kicking leg while btwist lands on your jumping leg

Most of our drills today aim to get your body to understand how to twist --- spin like a rotiserrie chicken in a position that allows you to maintain your flatspin like a frisbee
