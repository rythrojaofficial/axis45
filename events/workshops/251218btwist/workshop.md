**Flatspin**: spin like a frisbee

**Twist**: spin like a rotisserie chicken

A complete Twist without flatspin is closer to a btwist than a bkick without twist.

Most complications while learning btwist boil down to falling out of a twisting shape.

The majority of our drills aim to start with twisting on an axis that allows flatspin to continue, then reintroducing the flatspin later

## Methods

### Twisting Shape
The **Open Hip** position is a stable twisting shape suggested for beginners.  If you spin left, your left leg will externally rotate like in a butterfly stretch.  
- you must maintain a straight tightarch position from your head through your other knee
    - ideally all the way through the ball of foot, but through knee is mandatory
- rotating leg must pull into rotation
- arms must pull into rotation

1. standing find position, hopping, squat to pull
> #### Variants
>
> The **Eagle** or Raiz position is a commanding twisting shape appropriate for swingthroughs.  Essentially an open hip position with a straightened pulling leg.
> 
> The **crossleg** position is a quick twisting shape used for multi-twisting tricks.  Essentially an open hip position such that the ankles are tightly crossed like a figure skater


#### Pop 360 method
*from standing*
1. hopping in the open hip position
1. frontside360 in open hip position
    1. frontside position is feet forward in direction of momentum
    1. pivot to face back the way you came
    1. or land on 2
    1. or land on the pulling leg
1. frontside lunging 360 in open hip position
    1. butterfly plant leg should be forward
1. vertical spin step inside360 in open hip position
    1. pivot to face back the way you came
    1. or land on 2
    1. or land on the pulling leg
#### Lift + Pivot method
*stay on a line, don't cross line*
1. Pivot open
    1. goal is 45degrees
    1. try to complete pivot on floor to face the way you came
1. Line Lift + Pivot open
1. 90degree BLift + Pivot open
1. vertical line jumping 360 in open position
1. vertical spin step 90 degree Blift to line jumping 360 in open position

#### U Dip

1. whole movement follows the arc of the dip
1. squat and a hinge
1. pivot feet as you dip (may happen in the air if you spin step)

#### Foot Position
1. Plant leg: forward at takeoff
1. kicking leg: not too wide. you need to jump off both

#### Push and Kick
1. Follow the timing of the U dip.  The dip should help you jump
1. Both legs should push
1. Kicking leg should push into the kick
1. The purpose of the kick is to lift the hips, which should help you jump
1. the final point of jumping should be a little push, if the timing is right

#### Arms
1. Follow the timing of the U dip.  Sync up with legs.
1. kicking leg arm: lift with kicking leg for height and twist initiation
1. plant leg arm: reach around and to the hip for flatspin initiation and twist acceleartion

#### Twisting Shape
1. Axis is from head through knee of the kicking leg 
1. jumping leg must be externally rotated to aid in rotation
    1. note: straight is not necessary, basic open hip is easiest.
1. arms pull to hip


#### Landing Position
1. It's ok to land on both when you are learning, and pivot around.
    1. ideally you will land on the plant leg, and not the kicking leg
    1. twisting in the open hip position makes it possible to hold the twist until you land, wherever that might be.

### Flatspin Mechanics
#### BPivot
1. without jumping, utilize your U dip's flatspin momentum and upwards momentum to pivot all the way around
1. focus on same arm as kicking leg: reach around to initiate flatspin
1. although we are not fully jumping, you should get that weightless feeling of being pulled by your arms and legs
#### Bkaydem
1. the above, now jumping: the jump should be a continuation of the momentum + a push from the plant leg
1. if this one is not integrated, you will have trouble btwisting.

### Twisting rhythm
### Bkick
1. try to maximize flatspin using Bkaydem ideas
1. focus on feeling the rhythm of the "kick kick" pattern
#### Bkaydem + open hip position

1. focus on same arm as plant leg: elbow up behind you to initiate twist
1. same rhythm as "kick kick": kick, open hip
1. maintain straight tightarch position to stay on axis: avoid crunching in by "sitting up"
1. pivot back to face the way you came

### Integration using Training Aids 
1. block tunnel method
    1. pay extra attention to:
        1. arms and kicking leg coming up together
            1. 

        1. looking into your twist
        1. twisting up
        1. lifting your hip
    1. open hip twisting position
1. diagonal over the block method
    1. 2 hands down bkick over diagonal block
        1. focus on rhythm of the connected 2 kicks
    1. 1st hand down bkick + twist over diagonal block
        1. 2nd hand punches wide to opposite hip to spin
        1. avoid sitting up, finish facing opposite the way you came
        1. do not cross the diagonal
    1. no hands bkick + twist
        1. first elbow lifts into twist with kicking leg
        1. second hand punches wide to opposite hip
        1. avoid sitting up, finish facing opposite the way you came
        1. do not cross the diagonal
### Testing

1. twisting butterfly kick up to mat (hands and knees)
1. cartwheel twist
