<!-- ### similarities:


1. flipping rotation (flatspin)
    1. they should both flatspin (like a frisbee) 180degrees (halfway around)
1. timing and takeoff
    1. butterfly kick has a kick kick timing. butterfly twist has the same 2 part timing when done well. 
    1. crucial to be familiar with the timing.  
        1. beginners will use only the first timing to do everything
        1. more advanced twisters will use the first kick timing for the first half spin and the second kick timing for the second half spin -->
<!-- ### differences:


1. twisting rotation 
    1. twisting here refers to spinning (like a kickflip or rotisserie chicken) while flatspinning(like a frisbee)
    1. bkick has no twisting rotation, and btwist has one full twist
1. landing position
    1. bkick lands on your the kicking leg while btwist lands on your jumping leg -->


> **Flatspin**: spin like a frisbee
> **Twist**: spin like a rotisserie chicken

Most of our drills today aim to get your body to understand how to twist on the correct axis that allows flatspin to continue.

#### U Dip

1. whole movement follows the arc of the dip
1. squat and a hinge
1. pivot feet as you dip (may happen in the air if you spin step)

#### Foot Position
1. plant leg forward at takeoff
1. not too wide: we'll be jumping off of both legs

#### Push and Kick
1. Follow the timing of the U dip.  The dip should help you jump
1. Both legs should push
1. Kicking leg should push into the kick
1. The purpose of the kick is to lift the hips

#### Arms
1. Follow the timing of the U dip.  Sync up with legs.
1. opposite arm: lift with kicking leg for height and twist initiation
1. same arm: reach around and to the hip for flatspin initiation and twist acceleartion
