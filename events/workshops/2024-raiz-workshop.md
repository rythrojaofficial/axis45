# Beginner-Intermediate Raiz Workshop

<!-- run + warm up 10m -->

### This style of Raiz

- circular, as opposed to linear
- horizontal as opposed to fully inverted
- lends itself to frontswing, pivot
- Looks good on its own
- "Every Trick is a Raiz"

### iron man eagle pivot

<!-- squat + hinge -->

- push style, swing style
- as you push hands down:
  - open chest
  - extend hips
- pivot on the lead leg
  - same arm as lead leg
  - eyes
  - actively trail back leg

**From trail leg**:

- squatted
- pivot as above

**From trail leg with hop**

- squat push as you iron man
