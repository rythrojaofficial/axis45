# Technical Sequences Workshop

## tl;dr

At it's core, repetitive technical sequence training is copy-pasting small chunks of tricks multiple times.

### Key Benefits

1. Repetition
   1. tricks
   2. transitions
2. Integrate
   1. once you learn a new skill, you can integrate
3. Momentum flow
   1. build
   2. conserve
   3. capitalize
4. Contextualize
   1. data points for actual combos
5. Tuning
   1. like instrument tuning
   2. making one trick more like another

## Definitions

## What are the benefits of Technical sequence training?

1. **Momentum**
   - an tricker in motion stays in motion
   - an tricker at rest stays at rest

> The most valuable power source for a tricker is not strength, but rather _momentum_. No matter how strong you are, you are achieving a very small fraction of your potential power if you are relying on pure standing strength. If your combo is continuously stop and go, you are literally working twice as hard since 1. stopping your momentum takes energy; 2. starting from nothing takes energy.

**Technical Sequences** is a form of repetitive [tricking] training designed to allow practitioners to practice efficiently integrate existing skills while also preparing for new ones.
