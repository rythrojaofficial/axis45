### Handstand line

1.  Critical
    1. open shoulders
    1. ribs/core
    1. tuck hips/squeeze butt
2.  Secondary
    1. eyes, head / cover ears
3.  quads/knees
4.  Tertiary

    1. toes

5.  Practice ideas
    1. floor, prone/supine, plank
    1. hanging
    1. wall

### Mobility

Flexibility + strength

1. wrist health is the number one reason why people quit handstand training
   1. wrist activation

_Restricted Shoulder Mobility is the number one factor in the shape of your handstand_

1. Shoulder Flexion
   1. Bar Hang
   1. Kneeling
   1. weighted
1. Hip Flexion
   1. kneeling tuck
   1. Pike
   1. Straddled Pike

### Shape, Shape Change

1. Basic shapes
   1. tuck
   1. pike
   1. straddle
1. to look up later:
   1. split
   1. stag
   1. figa
   1. flag
1. Practice Methods
   1. floor
   1. candlestick
   1. Headstand
   1. Handstand

### Compression

1. active shape
1. Compressions to practice
   1. tuck, pike, straddle

### Straight Arm Pressing Strength

1. Press Handstand
   1. elevated lean off
1. Planche (extremely important for wrist health)
   1. Pseudo lean
   1. positional frogs

### Bent Arm Pressing Strength

1. HSPU
   1. pike push up, wall, weighted press
1. Bent Arm Press
   1. isometrics, eccentrics, partials

### Balance

1. Stiffness/rigidity
   1. no wet noodles
   1. yet you do NOT need squeeze 100%
1. Available levers

   1. Primary
      1. shoulders
      1. wrists
   1. Secondary
      1. hips
      1. head

1. Short term balance (<30s)
   1. more squeeze
1. long term balance(>30s)

   1. rely on your strengths
   1. less squeeze
   1. cycle
   1. breathing

1. correction
   1. piking
   1. planching
   1. lowering center of gravity
      1. pushing, straddling, splitting

### Entrances

entrances are a skill to be practiced separately

1. dynamic push (not a jump)
1. straight arm pressing
1. bent arm pressing

### Spotting

1. Partners
   1. spot from the hip
   1. spot from the calf/shin

### Shifting

1. Walking
1. Center of gravity
1. Counterbalance
1. taps

### Exit
