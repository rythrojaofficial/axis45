# On Teaching Backflips at Axis
## Understanding the Stereotype
Tricking itself is a sport that regularly comes under heavy scrutiny for its perceived lack of understanding when it comes to safety and sensible best practices in regards to progression.

The entire point of our facility is to change that perception. Axis 45 prides itself on being a training center for those who understand and harness the power of well thought out progression. I myself have coached trampoline and tumbling gymnastics at every level all the way through the national level, and in doing so, ingrained a strong understanding of the skill-building process.

With this understanding, we are able to teach tricking to a much broader, and older population than almost anywhere else in the US. In contrast to the "trial by fire" approach where only the most talented, durable, and frankly lucky individuals survive the brutal early stages of the sport, nearly anyone willing to learn is able to make stable meaningful progress towards their goals.

If it is your intention to teach flips for profit at our facility, it is imperetive that you understand this responsibility for both yourself and for our space.

# Important Points to Consider for Teaching Backflips
## Necking
First consider the following:
> How many times shall it be considered acceptable for the student to fall on their head in the process of:
> 1. **Learning** to backflip?
> 2. being **Taught** to backflip?
> 3. being **Spotted** on a backflip?

If your answer is anything other than **zero** times, you need to have your head examined and your coaching credentials tossed into a volcano because you are an active threat to the health, safety, and lives of those you are attempting to teach.

## Being Able to Backflip
Being able to backflip is not a meaningful prerequisite to teaching a student to backflip.

It's a bonus to be able to demonstrate understanding and mastery of technique. 

AND YET, I would NOT list being able to backflip *even being able to flip exceptionally* as a meaningful credential to teaching backflips.

## Meaningful Credentials to Teaching Backflips
### 1. Understanding Risk
1. The main **risks** associated with learning backflips
	1. Nervous System: Neck/Spine/Nerve
		1. paralysis, death.
	2. Brain: Concussion
	3. Musculoskeletal:
		1. Primarily: Neck, Back, Ankles
		1. present to a lesser degree: wrists, knees, elbows, shoulders 
	4. Mental:
		1. Mental blocks happen **super quickly** if you badly bail once, you can set back the learning process 3-6 months.

If you properly understand risks, you will organize your training accordingly.
### 2. Understanding Readiness
You need experience in understanding when a student is ready and not ready for any given step.

*Especially* know when they are ready to flip for the **first time** AND for the **first time alone**

That is very rarely on Day 1.

### 3. Understanding Timelines
You need experience in understanding the potential *timeline* for someone learning to flip
1. 1 day *if*:
	1. the student is super athletic in the right ways, durable, and the right kind of overconfident (read: technically a little dumb).
	2. if you think this is more than 1 in 10 high performing athletes, you are going to get a lot of people hurt
2. a few weeks of practice, visualization, and spotting *if*:
	1. the student is athletic in the right ways, decently durable, and very risk-tolerant
	2. Most highly capable, risk-tolerant athletes should not be flipping until the 3rd or 4th lesson without extensive prior experience.
3. 4-6 months of consistent practice drills, visualization, exercise, and spotting *if*
	1. the student is minorly lacking in one or two or of the following categories: athleticism, extreme durability, risk-tolerance; OR is a one day/few weeks type of student who lands on their head and gets a mental block
4. 1 year of consistent practice drills, exercise, visualization, and spotting *if*
	1. the student is majorly lacking in one of the following categories or minorly lacking in many of the categories.
If the student could not make significant progress within 1 year of *consistent work*, either they really aren't cut out for it **OR more likely, the coach hasn't addressed one of the key components.**
### 4. Understanding Methodologies
You must have experience with a methodology to address the critical:
1. **Technical Components**
	1. jump/takeoff/set with:
		1. Arms/shoulders
		2. Legs/posterior chain
		3. Core to keep it together
	2. rotation as a concept
	3. the landing
	4. simulate putting it together
2. **Mental Components**
	1. Initial fear of going over backwards
	1. Midair freakouts
	1. First flip anxiety
		1. What is your last minute prep to get them on the right page?
3. **Physical Components**
	1. Being able to jump 
	2. Being able to rotate
	3. Being able to land safely
And Experience with progression, drills, and cues for the above

### 5. Understanding the Space
You need experience in understanding the potential & the shortcomings of any given piece of gym equipment.

What are the pros and cons of mats, pits, trampolines, airtracks, blocks, spotting belts, etc?

What setups (mats or otherwise) will you use.

### 6. Understanding Spotting

Spotting someone who has flipped before is **not the same** as spotting someone who is about to flip for the first time.

Spotting should be utilized as the final piece of the puzzle, not as the starting point.

Using the materials available to you, how would you spot someone's
1. first flip?
2. 2nd-5th flip?
3. 5th - 20th flip?
4. for confidence?

When and how will you:
1. cancel?
1. toss them over?
1. catch them?

### 7. Caring 

You must care about the health, safety, and lives of those you are teaching more than you care about them getting it today, or by whatever timeline.
