## About the Event

*Straight from the judging sheet:*

>The purpose is to determine who performed better on this day by using a two pass comparison format. The first is a comparison of how they perform a required set of movements and the second is a comparison of how they have rehearsed and prepared their own movements. The advanced category is an exception only in that we will be solely judging what the competitors have prepared. They will be judged on their technique, speed, their application of the required passes, their creativity during their optional passes, and of course, their style and execution. Competitors will be judged by three judges from varying backgrounds and will be using a point based system to track competition scores.
>
>In Tricking, we have several ways of testing our abilities. Battles, games, and bounties have all been vital in the enabling of an individual’s growth, as well as the community. Our goal is to create another avenue of competition that allows athletes to prepare and present in a way similar to a martial arts tournament, a gymnastics competition, and dozens of other sports around the world. We believe that tricking has become standardized enough to make an accurate judging system that highlights the precision and discipline an athlete can have in this sport. Our hope is that this kind of competition will be easier for the athletes, better for the audience, and will have the same inspiring effect as any battle.
