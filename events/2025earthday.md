## About the Event 
[Invitational Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CNeEMOGY-I3WvGw91sKMb-Zu0rW3dz9SqcELI3s2hGU/edit)

*Straight from the judging sheet:*

> In Tricking, we have several ways of testing our abilities. Battles, games, and bounties have all been vital in the enabling of an individual’s growth, as well as the community. Our goal is to create another avenue of competition that allows athletes to prepare and present in a way similar to a martial arts tournament, a gymnastics competition, and dozens of other sports around the world. We believe that tricking has become standardized enough to make an accurate judging system that highlights the precision and discipline an athlete can have in this sport. Our hope is that this kind of competition will be easier for the athletes, better for the audience, and will have the same inspiring effect as any battle.
