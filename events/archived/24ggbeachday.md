<!-- ### Golden Gardens beach day! -->

_weather permitting_, Join us outside for:

- üèñÔ∏è **hangout / tricks / volleyball / bbq / bonfire**
- üìç [Golden Gardens Beach Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rY3TmzS4Xatzsvz88)
- üïì ~**4pm** through sunset

We'll probably set up on either side of the [Grove](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BbtYDEfbUeQhtur38) in case you have a hammock

**Parking can be tough**. Do check the lots, but usually we park further on the [street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QHGuXVoUmNGWNFyj7) and walk or skate the rest of the way.

Do bring:

- sunscreen
- beach blanket/towel
- change of clothes & towel (if you might swim)
- snacks & drinks
- water bottle
- sun shade

It would be cool to bring:

- chair
- frisbee/ball
- paddleboard
- blanket/hoodie _in case it's cold in the evening_
- something to cook on a griddle
  - sausage, zucchini, salmon, steak, naan, etc

<blockquote>

_Hey everybody! This is your good buddy and/or former co-worker Hunter reaching out for beach day plans!_

_So the plan is currently to have a good ol beach day at Golden Gardens Beach at 8498 Seaview Pl NW, Seattle, WA 98117
Happening this Saturday the 7th. It's a BYOB thing so grab whatever drinks you wanna bring. Snack stuff is appreciated I have a friend who's planning to cook some yakitori on the beach but some bags of chips will make that stretch further for sure._

_Time wise it sounds like we're aiming for an afternoon into evening thing starting around 3pm and going until dark so we can have a bonfire on the beach!_

_I'll be bringing a volleyball net and ball as well for all my fellow volleyenthusiasts to play with other things to think about bringing are obviously a swimsuit, any kinds of beach towels or chairs to spread out and sit on, sun umbrellas if you got em. Paddle boards are also used out there if you're feeling ambitious and have your own gear._

_If they'd be willing to reach out to me to RSVP so I can have a general idea of how many are coming I'd appreciate it_

you can just mention you're coming in the discord :)
