# DELTA scale for NAG
## Difficulty

How hard the tricks themselves were to land

### Rotations, flips, and variations

list out trips, variated dubs, double variated singles, flips, etc.

compare difficulty of takeoffs eg. tak > swing > punch, etc

compare difficulty of variation, eg. hyperhook is more difficult than round 

### Questionable difficulty

under-rotated fullSnapu would still be pretty weak dub variation

an over-rotated halfu is a pretty strong single variation

depending on how it's done of course.
Execution

How well executed were the tricks themselves

    Full score:

standard "average execution" of said trick

    Bonus: 

Mild to moderate bonuses may be awarded for well executed or "textbook" quality tricks respectively

Major bonus may be awarded for beyond textbook, stylized versions of tricks, extra spicy/icy/sharp

    Penalty:

A minor, moderate, or major execution penalty shall be deducted for notably poor "charmander-level" execution of a given trick.
Landing

A landing is an abrupt ending to a combo.

    Full score:

If landed, whether clutched or not

    Bonus:

Minor, moderate, or major bonuses may be awarded for landings to position, stuck, or satisfyingly stomped so as to show how easy it was for them

    Penalty:

A minor to moderate fall penalty will be deducted for incomplete landings. Touch hands, or Drop knees, questionably clutched or stumbled landings

A major fall penalty will be deducted if the tricker falls hard but touches feet/legs first (assuming feet is the intended landing)

There will be a major consideration for forfeit point for sacrificial slams that land anything other than feet first except in intentional cases such as rollouts/airdrops

    Transitions
        Full Score

        smooth transitions without significant energy loss UNLESS there is intentional tempo change
        Bonus

        Minor, moderate, or major bonuses  may be awarded for exceptional momentum building/tempo changing transitions
        Penalty

        A minor to moderate penalty may be taken for transitions that seem to stutter (with or without tiny adjustment steps) or utilize clear "recovery" clutching

        A major penalty may be taken for falls or unplanned stoppages that manage to recover
    Artistry
        Choreography/Presentation
        Full Score

        If the judges/audience is addressed, a pass is done, and the judges/audience is addressed
        Bonus

        Minor, moderate, or major bonuses may be awarded for 

            1. unpredictability (that makes you go woah)

            2. something really creative (that makes you go woah)

            3. something well choreographed (rhymes, rhythms, medleys, etc)

            4. hype presentation (that makes you interested)
        Penalty

        Minor penalty may be taken for passes with notable lack of presentation
