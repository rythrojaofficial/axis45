## What is Tricking

  

- In 3 words, Tricking is **Acrobatic Martial Arts**, with emphasis on the arts. 

- For a little more detail:

- Tricking is an **Artistic Discipline** that explores acrobatic movement through elements incorporated from Martial Arts, Tumbling, and Dance

- breaking it down further:

- **explores acrobatic movement** through elements incorporated from Martial Arts, Tumbling, and Dance

- We're exploring movement

- we're integrating ideas, movements, shapes, transitions

- we incorporate, integrate, modify, and reimagine these into our own tricking.

- tricking is an artistic discipline

- Trickers, we want to see your compositions: your choices, rhthyms, rhymes, and chords. Simply choosing what to incorporate is an art in itself.

- but then we get to bring those ideas to life!

- you could have 2 trickers do the exact same combo on paper, and have it look completely diffent.

- Tricking brings out everyone's background.

- if you're naturally stronger than you are flexible, we'll see it

- Or if you're naturally more flexible than you are strong, we'll see it

- If you did martial arts: tkd, wushu, capoeira? we'll see it.

- if you did tumbling, breaking, ballet, ANYTHING, we will see it.

- what i'm saying is that we want to see you through your tricking. and that artistic expression to me is my favorite part about tricking.  

## Learn flips

- If you know someone that wants to learn tricking, and/or flipping or you yourself are wanting to learn tricking and/or flipping:

- We've got the classes for you on Thursday evenings

- We start a 4 week cycle of tricking foundations on the first Thursday of every month (that is next week thursday at 6:30pm)

- tricking foundations is tricking 101. No experience is required (just be moderately healthy and be able to run and jump). Even if you come from a flipping or martial arts background, learning the tricking-specific shapes, setups, takeoffs, positions, and how they're all connected can take you from a person that does tricks to a tricker.

- If the whole tricking thing seems a bit complicated and you just want to learn to flip, that class is right after tricking foundations at 7:30pm

- we do everything you need to safely learn frontflip, backflip, and sideflip

- If you or someone you know are interested in tricking and/or flipping, registration is open for the september session starting next thursday at 6:30pm

  ## Classes

- Tuesday Guided Tricking

- Did y'all know we're here on Tuesdays?

- It used to be beginner friendly tricking but everyone that comes to that got too good so now it's intermediate guided tricking.

- We also do tricking exercise after that

- plyos, explosive stuff, abs, and handstand things

- you know everything trickers know to do, but have a hard time sticking to routine on.

- Sunday Stretch and Break

- Sundays we do a long form stretch, ~ 2 hrs of stretch.

- we all know we gotta be stretching but lets be real

- we'll stretch when we get home, but then . . .

## Empower

- Have you said hi to Gina over in the garage?

- Gina is a Doctor of Physical therapy and the owner of Empower Manual Therapy on our wall. Her clinic is down the road in shoreline.

- She's been taking care of us basically since we started.

- Gina, do you have words for the Not a Gathering folk?

- If you need physical therapy (if you do trick, you definitely need physical therapy) she's our person. If you have any questions or need taping or anything like that, please check in with Gina

  

## body wipes
- we've got a lot of bodies in the room today, some getting a little sweatier than others. yup it's natural
- BUT we're gonna be here a while so if you start feeling extra sweaty, please grab a body wipe over near the garage to freshen up
- plant based cloth with tea tree, eucalyptus, and chamomille.

  
# comp meeting
## The competition format
  
- Tonight, We're using an experimental and low stakes comp format.

- the aim is to have as many people competing as possible.

- Historically competitions and battles have been for only the strongest trickers.

- that left a lot of trickers sitting on the sidelines preferring not to participate at all.

- Battling, competitions, shows are a big part of the tricker experience.

- I think you learn a lot about yourself by challenging yourself in this way.

- tonight we want to make the stakes as low as possible. Here are some ways we'll try to do that:

- You have a single pass you decide ahead of time

- you get a general warm up time

- you get group warm up time

- you get 1 warm up run

- you get 2 attempts at your pass (if desired)

- You are only judged on your best pass as decided by our panel of fair and friendly judges sitting on their throne back there.

- Does everyone know our judges? These are Local legends: we got Halen, Jeremy, Jon, Alex, Andrew, who've been tricking for like 15 years?

- As a reminder: you are competing for some hardware tonight

- our Intermediate categories (A2-A4) will have one single winner each

- Pre 
- A2 Basic flips and twists are duking it out for Vulpix

- A3 intermediate flips, twists, variations, or connections are gunning for Gengar

- A4 Advanced flips, twists, variations, or connections are fighting for Dragonite

- Our Open Category (s+) will have top 3 spots as decided by our judging panel

- Battle ready competitors will go full send for one of 3 medals

- Bronze Mew

- Silver Mewtwo

- Gold Arceus

- these were all 3d printed and hand painted by jon by the way!

- with that, let's get cooking!

- A2 competitiors get ready!

  

## Competition flow

  

- _A2 group 1(or other) competitors are being called_

- _if you hear your name, make your way over to the staging mat_

- **check that everyone is there**

- alright fellas, you got 3 minutes of general warm up. I recommend coming from the mural wall if you trick to the left and the matted wall if you trick to the right. please take turns and good luck!

- **3m go**

- _A2 group 1 general warm up has concluded_

- competitors from this point on, please stay in order. Remember who is in front of you, and who is in back.

- Let's have the first competitor sitting on or near the orange staging dot.

- the second can sit at the far left of the rolled mat and the last competitor standing on the far right.  yes you can stand.

- once everyone is in order, we can one at a time, take your one warm up pass and re-enter the line in the same order.

- When the first competitor is announced (#1, first pass), they can make their way over to their preferred side (or center if desired)

- Acknowledge the judges with a bit of eye contact. Perform your pass.

- to conclude your pass, acknowledge the judges and crowd with a little wave, hit an emote or whatever you want to do and head to the back of the line.   

- if you don't wish to take a second pass, give us a big x when your name is announced

- _A2 competitors have finished their warm up passes_

- _judges are you ready?_

- _competitors are you ready?_

- _first up from . . . we have # 1_
