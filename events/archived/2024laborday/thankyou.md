Not a Gathering comes to a close!

Thank you to everyone who attended NAG2 as participants, volunteers, and spectators! We had an amazing time hosting our second annual Labor Day Mini: Not a Gathering (2). We hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did!

We learned a lot from last year's event and were super pumped to implement the changes. How did we do? If you liked the experimental, low-stakes format, please let us know! We’d love to hear about your experience. We still have a long way to go of course, but we are super excited for what comes next!

Finally, shout-outs! I'd like to give a giant special THANKS to:

✴️Everyone who had to drive a very very long way in PAX traffic to hang out @pdxtricking

✴️DJ @slava.ur (and guest DJ @sush.remix) for keeping the energy up the entire night;

✴️Dr. Gina of @empower_manual_therapy for providing sideline cover and taking care of us and our bodies

✴️@pndub_jon for creating the coveted custom 3d-printed (and painted) hardware;

✴️@mushroomjoey, @mktorpid @oh_its_jer, @smolsnark, @andrew_kain, Slava, Jon for volunteering (for real we could not have done it without you 😭)

✴️@krismiyash.mt @rythroja.mt for the putting in countless hours over many sleepless nights, planning the event, and emceeing and guiding us from NAG2 start through finish;

✴️and last but not least, all of our Local Seattle Tricklers for continuously showing up and building this community with us—we are here doing this thing for and because of you 🫶
