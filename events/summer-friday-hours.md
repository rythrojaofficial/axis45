### Friday Open Tricking: 8-10pm

The sun is setting later and we tend to run late (and also start late) on Fridays. It just makes sense for the sunnier months ☀️  This may change back around October.

### Mondays Open Tricking: 7-9pm

Mondays will remain normal since most of us still have work in the mornings 😅

### All Other days remain normal

See our [Current Offerings](https://www.seattletricking.com/current-offerings) for a full listing!
