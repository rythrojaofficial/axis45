## Off-Hours Training
If you can't make it to regular session, need extra practice, or just want the privacy of a private session (not lesson), *Off-hours training* might be for you.

Off-hours training is subject to availability. 

A gym owner or keyholder will be present to open and supervise. Email jared@mercenarytricking.com or dm @seattletricking on instagram for inquiries.

- 1 participant: $10 / 30m
- 2 participants: $9 / 30m per person
- 3-4 participants: $7.50 /30m per person
- 5+ participants: $5/30m per person

## Private Lessons
There's a lot you can learn just by being in the gym and talking to people, but there is nothing quite like an expert laying the foundations for you to succeed.  You'll learn both the what and the why.

If you are looking to cut to the chase and learn from a professional, *Private lessons* are what you're after.

Private lessons are subject to availability

Starting base rate: $85/hr

Pricing starts at $85/hr, but there are many factors that go into pricing that could make a better deal.  Please have the below questions in mind before inquiring.

Pricing Considerations:
1. Duration:
    - 60m is good for single focus lessons (eg. just backflip)
    - 90m is good for multiple areas of focus (eg. raiz, gainer, btwist)
    - 120m is good for "I want to get better at tricking" in general and will do what is necessary.
2. Frequency:
    - As needed
    - 3-5x/month (weekly-ish)
    - 6-9x/month (biweekly-ish)
    - 10+x/month (triweekly-ish+)

There is lots of wiggle room, but this is a good starting place logistically.






## Facility Rentals
If you have a project that could make use of the space, for longer hours/more people, a *Facility Rental* might be what you're looking for.

Facility rentals are subject to availablilty and must be scheduled at least 1 month in advance.

There will be a designated responsible party signing a contract with a downpayment. 

A gym owner or keyholder will open the gym, but otherwise leave you do your own devices.
