There's a lot you can learn just by being in the gym and talking to people, but there is nothing quite like an expert laying the foundations for you to succeed.  You'll learn both the what and the why.

If you are looking to cut to the chase and learn from a professional, **Private lessons** are what you're after.

*\*Private lessons are subject to availability.*

Please use our [Contact Page](https://www.seattletricking.com/contact) to inquire about private lesson base rates and availability.

Pricing starts at an hourly base rate, but there are many factors that go into pricing that could lower an hourly rate.  Please have the below questions in mind before inquiring.

- Days/Times

Pricing Considerations:

1. Duration, with longer lessons having the best value:
    - 60m 
    - 90m  
    - 120m 
2. Frequency, with more frequent lessons having the best value:
    - As needed
    - approximately every other week
    - approximately once per week
3. Focus, with more focused lessons having the best value:
    - multiple areas of focus (eg. raiz, gainer, btwist)
    - main line tricking
    - Single focus: (eg. just backflip)

There is lots of wiggle room, but this is a good place to start.
