# Tuesday Tricking Exercise

`from the website:`

_Bust through plataeus by focusing on the physical component._

_A consistent monthly training regimen that accounts for athleticism, elasticity, strength, balance, skill-specific strength, injury prevention and more_.

_For best results, come to tricking exercise for the whole month._

## The Point of Tuesday Exercise

**To expose or introduce A45 members to the following:**

1. training structure that consists of
   1. stable monthly exercise
   2. covering bases
   3. progressing certain areas
   4. addressing weak spots in individuals' routines
2. Key training concepts of physicality
   1. overall athleticism
      1. coordination
      2. power
      3. speed
      4. balance
      5. strength
      6. endurance
   2. skill specific conditioning
   3. elastic and explosive power
   4. corrective exercise
      1. for micro/macro imbalances
      1. for accessory muscle groups
      1. soft tissue remodeling
3. variety of stimuli
   1. plyometrics
   2. weightlifting
   3. running/jumping
   4. explosive movements
   5. rotation/antirotation
   6. linear and lateral
   7. acceleration/decelleration
   8. landing mechanics
   9. proprioception
   10. compression/end-range strength
   11. eccentric, isometric, concentric loading
   12. unilateral/bilateral
   13. movement patterns
   14. agility
   15. wolff's law
4. variety of training protocols
   1. circuits
   2. complexes
   3. supersets
   4. contrast methods
   5. rest/pause
   6. EMOM
   7. AMRAP

**And to serve both newer members and consistent core group alike**

The goal is to be able to fill roughly 85% of the training needs of the consistent members whilst continuing to be very approachable to the beginner to integrate.

This is a tricky balance in a number of ways:

1. shorter cycles benefit newer members, longer cycles better for consistent groups
   1. compromise happens to be monthly stable schedule with rotating/progressing staples
   2. even though the workout is changing, some elements should be either progressing or rotating in a sensible way such that it introduces those new concepts to the newbies while also providing stability for the consistent ontes
      1. eg. we did dragon flags for 3 months, in different styles, eccentric, isometric, and concentric, introducing 3 training concepts whilst maintaining consistency for a longer duration
2. learning curves for certain exercises make them less ideal candidates in spite of their potential upsides
   1. eg. olympic lifts. we had trouble even with front squat
   2. instead, power movements like jump squat, landmine jerk, thrusters, medball throws, sprints, and box jumps can fill a similar role
      1. even if slightly less optimal, are MUCH more accessible
3. exercises must be easy to scale up or down
4. there should be minimal training risk
5. foster sense of community in ways that beginner classes and open sessions do not
   1. **"Kizuna" (絆)** – a Japanese term meaning deep bonds formed through shared experience, especially hardship.

### What it's not

**An optimized and fully tailored block periodized training program.**

If we had an A45 team, that could be possible, where I or you had pretty good control over 80+% of what people did in a week, 2-4 training days 2-4hrs, and their main activity is tricking with a specific competition in mind (ie. vertigo battles).

Honestly, even then, the difference would be marginal. Like going from around 80-85% optimal to 85-90% optimal (to go beyond you'd need individual training).

In addition to being an effective damage control and plateau busting protocol, this class should be a very accessible well rounded gateway to working out for tricking

The reality is that there will be many newer members who are looking to participate for the first time, as we did ourselves.

**A hacked together "Arbitrary Exercises" Workout**

The starting point may be arbitrary, because you need to start somewhere. But everything should fit together like the pieces of a puzzle balancing several dichotomies of training newer and experienced athletes.

1. There are perhaps an infinite number of ways to stimulate the intended adaptation, however the combination must work with:
   1. your specific group's range of training age, skill level and number of individuals
   2. the time of year
   3. the space/equipment available
2. Looking back we need to see what exercise families need to be progressed, which need to be modified, and which need to be replaced/removed.
3. Planning of exercise
4. review of previous workouts
5. Explain and look for patterns, dichotomies, principles
   1. endurance -> strength -> power
   2. athleticism
      1. coordination and efficiency in sprinting, bounding, jumping, acceleration, deceleration, agility
   3. proficiency and quality and output of strength patterns:
      1. squat, hinge, horizontal/vertical push, horizontal/vertical pull
   4. eccentric, isometric, concentric exercises
   5. bondarchuk categories
      1. general physical preparatory exercise
      2. special preparatory exercise
      3. special developmental exercise
      4. competitive exercise
   6. dichotomies
      1. unilateral vs bilateral
      2. elastic vs explosive
      3. linear vs lateral
      4. maintenance vs focus
      5. consistency vs novelty

### The Mission

`Clearly define the **goal** of the operation or project.`

**To create and implement the month's tuesday workout plan**

1. taking into account what we've just done recently, what we've done in the past, and where we're headed in the future
1. utilizing principles of exercise science, and practical training experience, and the science/art of coaching to produce stimulate intended adaptation
1. using available resources (floor, benches, weights, bars, racks and anything else available to you)

`What is the intended outcome?`

To provide the quality experience we've come to expect from Tuesday Tricking Exercise, as a proof of concept to the rest of the group, who may or may not undertake the same mission in the future

1.  Implementation of exercise plan
    1.  Primary will pre-emptively explain commander's intent and/or demonstrate key details and traps
        1. example of intent:
           for 3 for 3 it could only work if the first three's intent was to be pristine motor
           pattern and second three was to have maximal intent
    2.  Secondary will asked prompting questions to help crew understand intent and flow
1.  Specifics planning
    - what should the arms do in backward skipping?
    - order of exercises in circuit
    - which exercises needed weights (are there enough weights to go around?)
    - fitting people on stations, bars, etc?

### Practical templating advice

#### plyos (running/jumping)

1. 1-2 running drills
1. bounding/rebounding exercise/plyo
1. a sprint and or jump(s)

#### main strength/power/hypertrophy movements

1. a squat
1. a hinge
1. a push (horizontal/vertical)
1. a pull (horizontal/vertical)
1. a flipping core (forwards/backwards)

#### Secondary/Accessory bloodflow, prehab, corrective exercise, balance, etc

1. shoulders, neck, backs, hip flexors, calf/achilles, wrist, etc

### Class Management principles

#### simple

- is it too complicated?
- should be a good balance of challenging motor patterns and solid basics
- in the meta sense:
  - circuits should follow a circle. Anything else is confusing and will result in missing things or getting doubled up

#### intent

- it's not what you do it's how you do it
- for every exercise there should be an intent
  - maximum height on a jump, controlled contraction on a pull up, full body umph on a power exercise, etc
- try to get ahead of the troops, anticipating where they may fall into certain traps

#### Try first

- have people try out more complicated exercises for the first time BEFORE doing it all out. It will save you and them a lot of headache and embarrassment for all parties
- although it takes time, especially in a circuit, make sure it's done appropriately before sending them to do a round of it themselves.

#### Check for understanding

- check in often that the crew understands
- it get's them thinking about whether they do or not
- if someone doesn't, it's better to address early since we only have 4-5 weeks on a cycle
- sometimes commander has to explain it a different way, analogy, background
- if something is important, you should remind them that it is important and maybe why.
  1. "guys listen up this one is important so make sure you understand that:"
     1. it's week one, go lighter than you think is necessary, we can always increase weight on week
     2. we want to feel constant tension since we're moving back to an endurance/bloodflow focus

#### Evoke Sports Psychology Arousal

> In sports psychology, arousal refers to an athlete's level of mental and physical readiness, and understanding and managing arousal is crucial for optimal performance, as both under-arousal and over-arousal can negatively impact performance.
>
> Here's a more detailed look at arousal in sports psychology:
>
> What is Arousal?
>
> Definition: Arousal is the state of being physiologically alert, awake, and attentive.
>
> Spectrum: It ranges from deep sleep to panic, encompassing a wide range of mental and physical states.
>
> Importance: Finding the right level of arousal is essential for athletes to perform at their best.

Optimal is anxious but excited. AKA properly challenged. Basically get people in the zone.

1. think coach whistle, clap, countdowns, "ready ready ready, GO!"
1. anticipation: don't let the mind wander, there's a next thing
   1. "oh the next one's _really_ going to suck"
   1. "next up we've got \_\_\_\_"
1. pace slightly faster than is comfortable for the crew
   1. Not so much that they can't keep up
   2. but if there's too much lull, that's when there's opportunity to goof off.
   3. It's better to move slightly faster than ideal, with more frequent breaks.
      1. think interval training/pomodoro technique
1. Music
   1. can be a stimulant better than pre-workout
   1. can also be a distraction
   1. can also be used to bring people into a parasympathetic state (rest&relax)

#### partners/grouping

We want the pairings to work for the overall group first, then what's b1. one thing we should try to delegate to as many experienced individuals as possible is getting people to move along from break and to pay attention during instructions for individual pairs/groups

if someone's really new, it's a good idea to pair them with someone more experienced so that the blind aren't leading the blind

new people have little sense of the flow had a lot of trouble with normal intent of the basics, changing weights, how certain exercises should be done.

Having an experienced partner can help with that quickly

#### Delegate/Pre-organize/Pre-setup

1. either delegate portions of setup, pre-organize, or pre-plan
   1. "we're gonna need 2 sturdy benches at the edge of the floor for nordics"
1. For busy classes **explicitly** delegate ahead of time the responsibility for two class flow principles to experienced members
   1. Yes, get water/take a break, but go back to line when you're done
      - we've got gains to make 💪
   2. Try not to be distracting
      - Pay attention to instructions, they're important
        - If you already know, cool, please don't distract anyone who could benefit
        - If you don't, already know, the information is probably being said specifically for you
      - class chattiness is fine, but in excessive quantities, especially to and from newer people, can really dampen class momentum

#### practical circuit advice

1.  Have deep reservations about your circuit being anything other than a circle. People will inevitably get lost.

- If you decide to go off track there should be a very good reason and no good alternatives

1.  each station should take the same amount of time
    - If you have partners:
      - first exercise can be a 1 person thing, resulting in 2 turns
      - another exercise can be 2 people, but two sides, resulting in 2 turns
      - or if everything is timed, that works too.
      - lets try to minimize "bus bunching" in the workout
1.  consider what's before and after (will doing pull ups make doing leg lifts hard if they're back to back?)
1.  if there's lots of you, have an experienced person demonstrate while you explain
1.  if there's new people, you must explain how to set up things that require adjustment
    - weights, rings height, getting in and out of bands, how to add manual resistance/ securing partner
1.  do not have two beginners partnered together
    - don't let the blind lead the blind
