Write stuff down, regardless of practicality

1. Draw from your personal experiences.
1. Look up things that interest you or things you want to try.
1. Browse through resources, youtube, your saved insta posts, google etc

### 4. Solving the Puzzle:

Starting with what we've done recently and in the past, try to incorporate the brainstorming ideas while maintaining balance of several dichotomies, training protocols, and group training dynamics such as space and equipment constraints, timing and order of exercises.

1. Is there anything that is already set? _eg. running outside in the summer_
1. What things do we want to continue progressing? how?
1. What things have we adapted to and need to change up? how?
1. Do we have any new toys we need to try?

#### Early first draft

> ### Timeline:
>
> **by around the 15th**, try to have the early first draft sent for review

Don't worry about it being good, the reviewer wants to get a general idea of where your mind is headed so we can make sure the assignment is understood and course correct if necessary

#### Feedback + second draft

> ### Timeline:
>
> **by around the 22nd**, Try to have the second draft done and schedule your final walk through

Reviewer will give detailed feedback on your first draft asap. Please revise to spec if needed.

#### Feedback + final action items

> ### Timeline:
>
> **by the 1st of your month**, complete the following action items.
> Reviewer will give final feedback asap. Please revise to spec if needed

1. complete full walk through with reviewer OR send in Video examples of everything
1. Review class management principles under [Tuesday Tricking Exercise](https://seattletricking.com/secret_pages/misc) in Misc

> ### only IF you are a pair:
>
> #### Designate primary and secondary lead for Exercise
>
> - Primary will pre-emptively explain commander's intent and/or demonstrate key details and traps
>   - example of intent: for 3 for 3 it could only work if the first three's intent was to be pristine motor pattern and second three was to have maximal intent,
> - Secondary will asked prompting questions to help crew understand intent and flow
> - Reviewer will be a secondary as well
>
> #### Designation Options:
>
> 1. For the whole month, same primary and secondary for the whole exercise
>
>    - eg. person 1 is primary, person 2 secondary for all may,
>
> 1. For the whole month, split primary
>
>    - eg. person 2 is primary for running, and circuit, person 1 is primary for jumping, mobility, and bonus,
>
> 1. Alternating weeks as primary and secondary for the whole exercise
>
>    - eg. person 2 is primary for weeks 1 & 3,person 1 is primary for weeks 2 & 4
>
> _personally i'd suggest 2 since it gives both of you something to own for a month_

### 4. Implementation of week 1 + review

> ### Timeline:
>
> **By your second week**, send in any adjustments for review

In-person review with reviewer following week 1 shall discuss any possible pain points that we might want to make adjustments for.

Detailed written debrief by reviewer between week 1 and week 2 will provide even more context and maybe even supplemental material.

### Exit notes

>
> **By your 4th week**, send in your exit notes to your reviewer

1. What were your expectations going in to it?
