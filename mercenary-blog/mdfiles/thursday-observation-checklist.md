Proper _structure_ and lesson planning accounts for 60% of the success of a class. The other 40% comes from class management. Participating in a well-ordered class will provide insight on how a class should move along and feel.

It is another experience entirely to try to recreate the proper environment as its lead. We've taken that part for granted. It is our aim for you to get a baseline of understanding of Class Management and Group Training Principles

## Thursday Flipping Class Management Key Ideas

### Use of:

#### space

1. choice of lines, circle, circuit, garage, puzzle mats

#### time

1. sections
1. pacing
1. transitioning flow between
   1. spaces, sections, into breaks, out of breaks
1. pre-setup
   1. either delegate portions of setup, pre-organize, or pre-plan breaks
      1. "we're gonna need 2 sturdy benches at the edge of the floor for nordics"

#### resources

1. mats, walls, lines, partners, spotters, helpers
1. pairings/groupings
   1. is it one person at a time? 2? 3? all?
   1. does it matter how that was determined?

#### motivation & energy

1. language, tone, actions, pace

## pre-assignment instructions

_Instructions before people do things_

#### simple

1. keep things clear and concise
1. is it too complicated?
1. No matter how easy it is, someone is going to mess it up
   1. Make it even simpler

_note: do not overcomplicate things, especially for non-beginners---give them instruction on what to do, what not to do, and the intent_

If you struggle with the balance of keeping things simple and overcomplicating, you probably need to break the skill/drill down further

#### pre-emptive

_try to get ahead of the students, anticipating where they may fall into certain traps_

1. What to do, What not to do
1. visual examples
1. safety concerns

#### intent

1. it's not just what you do it's how you do it
1. for every exercise there should be an intent
   - maximum height on a jump, controlled contraction on a pull up, full body umph on a power exercise, etc

#### scalable

1. as much as possible, try make things scalable (accessible for various skill levels)
   1. have a backup alternative for the easier or harder versions

_As an added bonus, make things scalable, as in how do things change when there are more or less people in class?_

#### check for understanding

1. check in often that the crew understands
   - it gets them thinking about whether they do or not
1. if someone doesn't understand, it's better to address early
   - might have to explain it a different way, analogy, context
1. if something is important, you should remind them that it is important and maybe why.
1. "guys listen up this one is important so make sure you understand that:"
   1. it's week one, go lighter than you think is necessary, we can always increase weight on week
   2. we want to feel constant tension since we're moving back to an endurance/bloodflow focus

#### Try first

1. have people try out more critical/complicated exercises for the first time BEFORE doing it all out. It will save you and them a lot of headache and embarrassment
1. although it takes time, especially in a circuit, make sure it's done appropriately before sending them to do a round of it themselves.

## mid-assignment coaching

_feedback: what people who are not coaches think is 90% of what coaching is_

It is NOT what creates success, but it can be a helpful tool in your toolset

#### Reminders of:

1. intent
   - challenge them to have higher standards for themselves
     - eg. _more_ rotation, reach _higher_
1. safety concerns
   - draw attention to safety concerns frequently. It's something to remain vigilant of.

These reminders are the most useful piece of mid-assignment coaching that can be given. Gives the athlete _hopefully_ the right intent or puts their attention on safety concerns

#### pointing out flaws

not super useful, and is usually a duh moment.

- if done, better be done in conjunction with what should be done. or an opportunity for reflection on why it went weird

#### tips and corrections

- either keep it short and simple
  - if they're just getting something
- OR give them the speil with the why
  - if things have been stuck for a bit

#### Holding the line

means to provide very little slack when it comes to certain instructions

> eg. no heads touch the ground on forward rolls, dive rolls, etc

- hold the line in areas involving safety concerns
- hold the line for experienced people who's next step-up will require more focused intent and quality

#### Providing Slack

the opposite of holding the line. There is always nuance involved on when to hold the line and when to provide slack.

- provide slack for newer people in areas without safety concerns. . . until they are getting up to speed
  - eg. don't worry so much about pointing your toes.
- provide slack for more experienced people regarding certain things which they are well beyond that may no longer serve them.
  - eg. we don't need to change everyone's backflip technique just because we like our method best

#### encouragement

let them know when they're on the right track

- celebrate the wins. tricking is a tough sport.

#### answering questions to the group

If someone asks you a question on intent or execution of an item in a circuit or ortherwise:

1. It's good practice in a group setting to answer a question to everyone
   1. if one person has a question, probably many will
2. If i'm asking a leading question, it's probably because i see it as either a current ambiguity or potential pitfall in execution or intent

## Evoke Sports Psychology Arousal

> In sports psychology arousal refers to an athlete's level of mental and physical readiness, and understanding and managing arousal is crucial for optimal performance, as both under-arousal and over-arousal can negatively impact performance.

Optimal is anxious but excited. AKA properly challenged. Basically get people in the zone.

1. think coach whistle, clap, countdowns, "ready, set, GO!"
1. anticipation: don't let the mind wander
   1. "oh the next one's _really_ going to suck"
   1. "next up we've got \_\_\_\_"
1. pace slightly faster than is comfortable for the crew
   1. Not so much that they can't keep up
   2. but if there's too much lull, that's when there's opportunity to goof off.
   3. It's better to move slightly faster than ideal, with more frequent breaks.
      1. think interval training/pomodoro technique
1. Music
   1. can be a stimulant better than pre-workout
   1. can also be a distraction
   1. can also be used to bring people into a parasympathetic state (rest&relax)
