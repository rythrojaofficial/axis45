# Mercenary Tricking's Addendum to Dogen's Titanium Ankles

The ankle is the first major joint to receive impact with the ground in most tricks.  It is thus one of the most important for propulsion and energy absorption as well as one of the most commonly injured.  If you've been around the tricking community long enough, chances are you've heard of [Dogen's Titanium Ankles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21rwl0oWwuY) at some point or another.

At the time of it's release, Titanium Ankles was truly paradigm-shifting.  It set a standard for conditioning that trickers should be doing.  It suddenly made sense, "Yes, I need strong ankles if I want to survive in this sport, let alone excel.  This is how I must do it."

The tricking community, myself included, fully embraced Titanium Ankles.  I absolutely appreciate and admire the work that went into that video.  The ease with which its ideas were communicated and the easily actionable plan that went along with it was an easy sell.

Now it's 10 years later (2020) and it's clear that we as a community need to move past Titanium Ankles-era programs.  We owe it to Dogen to embrace truly strong ankles.

## A little History on Dogen's Titanium Ankles

When I started lurking the Tricks Tutorials forum circa 2008 there was a lot of training information floating around on the various tricking forums--most of it hearsay and bro-science.  When it came to addressing the various common ankle injuries, there wasn't any easily digestible resource regarding strengthening the muscles, tendons, and ligaments around the joints or how to mitigate injury.  Titanium Ankles was uploaded to YouTube 10 years ago and is still the most commonly recommended ankle guide to this day on every tricking platform.

Dogen was a prominent contributor to the Tricks Tutorials forum often remembered for his video tutorials on tricking concepts including Center of Gravity and Blocking.  Titanium Ankles opens with the painful reminder that we are mortal and ankles get rolled, sprained, or worse.  It then gives a well-warranted "If I knew back then what I knew now" spiel before showcasing an excellent example of strong ankles.  Anis performs a super high cork and we take it to slow-mo to see that his heels never touch the floor on his take-off OR landing!  Dude definitely had strong ankles.  The first half of the video deals with WHY we should strive for strong ankles--you will jump higher and be less injury-prone.  This aspect of the video is still relevant to this day.

Lets look at the second half, which discusses the METHOD for developing titanium ankles.  Dogen looks at the anatomy of the lower limb and concludes there are two muscle groups to worry about--the muscles of the calf responsible for plantar flexion (toe pointing) and the muscles of the shin responsible for dorsiflexion (toe flexion).  With this simplification we a get a few basic exercises necessary to improve ankle function and reduce risk of injury.  Here's a brief tl;dr of the second half of Titanium Ankles:

- shin raises and variations

- calf raises and variations

- walking on toes

- stretching plantar flexion and dorsiflexion

Performing the above will make you stronger and jump higher and greatly mitigate injuries

Dogen was on the right path conceptually but the methods are a little underwhelming considering the potential impact for it's user base.  There's enough information on the internet regarding the anatomy of the ankle.  Read on if you're ready to get a little more in depth into the function of the ankle.

## The Components of Truly Titanium Ankles

1. Proprioception & Stability  

1. Strength & Mobility 

1. Short-term and Long-term Neuromuscular Adaptation

### Proprioception & Stability

> "__Mechanical instability__ (MI) is defined as ankle movement beyond the physiologic limit of the ankle's range of motion. The term “laxity” is often used synonymously with MI. Functional instability is defined as the subjective feeling of ankle instability or recurrent, symptomatic ankle sprains (or both) due to proprioceptive and neuromuscular deficits." 
>
> \- *[Ankle Instability Revisited﻿](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC164386/)*

So if we want the joint stable, we need to address proprioceptive deficits.  We can think of the proprioceptive here as the ability to feel right and wrong positioning as well as the ability for the body to correct or avoid potentially harmful positioning.

__Proprioception__:  "Proprioception or balance is defined as the unconscious internal perception of movement and knowledge of the body’s orientation in space."  \- _[USA Gymnastics](https://usagym.org/pages/home/publications/technique/2009/02/23_ankle.pdf)_

> ... ankle proprioception and sports performance are directly related. Han et al. [18] measured ankle proprioception of 100 elite athletes from 5 different sports—aerobic gymnastics, soccer, swimming, badminton, and sports dancing—and found that ankle proprioception scores were significantly predictive of sport performance level, extending up to Olympic level.
>
> \- _[The Role of Ankle Proprioception for Balance Control in relation to Sports Performance and Injury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4637080/)_

Makes sense.  Good balance and spacial awareness will likely carry over to better control on take-off and landing, leading to improved performance and less injury.  Great!  How can I best improve proprioception and neuromuscular control?  Basically, it comes down to balancing between the following:

1. Stable surface training

1. Unstable surface training

1. Stable Surface Training

Proprioception can and should be trained on stable surfaces.  You must be stable on the surface that you are training and performing on!  Your body must have the coordination to put itself into a good position to avoid injury and to improve overall power output.

#### Ideas for Stable Surface Training

1. Balance

    1. Single Leg Balance

    1. Walking on Heels

    1. Walking on Arches

    1. Walking on Toes

    1. Standing on Heels balance

    1. Standing on Toes balance

    1. Standing on Arch balance

    1. Single Leg balance on Toes

    1. Single Leg balance on Heels

    1. Single Leg balance on Arch

    1. Single leg RDL 

1. Absorbing energy (sticking)

    1. Jump to stick 

    1. Single Leg jump to stick (Alternating Legs)

    1. Jump to Single Leg stick

    1. Single Leg Jump to single leg stick (on other leg)

    1. Single Leg Jump to Single Leg Stick (same leg)

    1. Lateral Jump to stick 

1. Redirecting energy (plyos)

    1. Hops side to side, front to back

    1. Single Leg Hops side to side, front to back

#### Unstable Surface Training

You're probably mostly familiar with "functional training" with bosu's and indo boards.  Bouncy  and uneven surfaces are unstable, simple as that.  If you train on trampolines, air floors, plyo, and even grass and sand, you're going to want to be able to stabilize and autocorrect.  Thus, it is functional in our case to occasionally be using unstable surface training to reduce risk of ankle injury.

Just remember that if you are training for tricking performance on a certain type of surface, you need be training on that certain type of surface.

### Mobility & Strength

Titanium ankles was a strong asset here.  Calf raises and shin raises and calf stretches and shin stretches are certainly essential to ankle health and performance.

1. __Strength of Primary Musculature__:  Muscles of the calf and shin

1. __Strength of Supporting Musculature__: Intrinsic muscles of the foot and toes

1. __Mobility of Surrounding Ligaments, Tendons, and Musculature__:  Plantar flexion, Dorsiflexion, Inversion, Eversion

Mobility and strength of the ankle go hand-in-hand.  If you have one without the other, you sell yourself short and put yourself at higher risk for injury.

## Neuromuscular Adaptation & Elasticity

__Neuromuscular__: Relating to Nerve and Muscle

__Neuromuscular Adaptation__:  The body's nerve and muscle optimization to a training stimulus.

[Bompa on Neuromuscular Adaptation to Strength Training](http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/neuromuscular-adaptations-to-strength-training)

Have you ever bounced on a trampoline for an hour then immediately tried tricking on the floor?  When you do, you may have experienced "Tramp legs"  which is basically an immediate neuromuscular adaptation to jumping on a nylon-bed trampoline.  Once you get to floor, it literally feels like you are jumping in slow motion because your nervous system has adapted to jumping on a slower surface.

The opposite of that would be the neuromuscular adaptation to jumping on more rigid surfaces.  Yes, jumping and rebounding on dead-floor/turf/court or whatever will literally help you jump faster and therefore higher by adapting your nervous system to jumping on a faster surface.  Let's hear it from an expert:

> "Many researchers suggested that [vertical jump test] and [standing long jump test] gains after plyometric training are attributed to a neural adaptation located in the nervous system rather than to morphologic changes [20–23]. According to these authors, neuromuscular factors such as increasing the degree of muscular coordination and maximizing the ability to use the muscle’s SSC (stretch shortening cycle) appear to be more important than changes in fiber size"
>
> \- _[Muscular adaptation to plyometric training](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4168734/)_

This suggests both short-term and long-term neural adaptation:

__Short-term Neural Adaptation__: Elastic Priming

__Long-term Neural Adaptation__: Elastic Power Training

_Fun Fact_:  Webbed or woven string-bed trampolines which are considered "fast" and give back the energy they receive, will affect your neural adaptation LESS than a nylon bed trampoline which is considered "slow" due to absorbing a larger portion of the energy given.

#### Elastic Priming

Elastic Priming refers to the short-term NM adaptation (up to ~ a week) to the speed of a surface that will influence how well your elastic components perform on any given surface.  This is done by increasing muscular coordination and maximizing the ability to use the muscle's SSC.

If you prime yourself to a slow surface (trampoline, fast track), your elastic components will not perform as optimally on a faster surface such as plyo or concrete.

__Tramp -> Floor__ = probably blah

If you prime yourself on plyo, your elastic components will perform effectively on plyo.

__Plyo -> Plyo__ = probably good

If you prime yourself to a fast surface like turf or dead floor, your elastic components will perform better than expected on a slower surface such as plyo or an air trick.

__Grass -> Plyo__ = probably feel like a super human

Remember that physicality is lower on the totem pole than timing and technique.  Slower surfaces are super helpful in providing extra air-time which allows the body to learn proper timing.  However, at the highest levels, it is critical is for trickers to be able to quickly jump and rebound on fast surfaces.

The good news is that the nervous system remains primed to the fastest surface you've adapted to in the long term with minimal upkeep so running or rebounding on a fast surface once per week should help keep you primed for jumping effectively on plyo even if you jump on tramps every session.

### The Vertebrate Catapult: Muscle-Tendon Synergy

Dogen got the two muscle groups right:  the calf group and shin group are indeed super important as parts of their respective muscle-tendon unit.  

In each muscle-tendon unit, muscle connects to tendon which in turn connects to bone.  To really highlight this point let's look at the famous example of an animal known for its spectacular jumping ability.

[Montana Naturalist: The Frog](http://www.montananaturalist.org/frog-jump/)

Below is an excerpt from Brown University researcher Henry Astley, who published a powerful article on the importance of the tendon to anuran (frog) jumping in 2011:

> Anuran jumping is a common model system for studying muscle-powered accelerations in vertebrates [1,2]. Skeletal muscles provide the mechanical power for the jump [1], but whole-body power output exceeds the maximum muscle power output by a factor of seven or more in some species [3,4]. These supramaximal power outputs are hypothesized to be the result of a catapult-like mechanism, which stores and subsequently releases elastic strain energy.

[Evidence for a vertebrate catapult: elastic energy storage in the plantaris tendon during frog jumping](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/3/386)

Basically, in very extreme cases, as in the frog here, 1 unit of the muscle output translated to 7 units of the muscle-tendon unit output--the muscles themselves only produced 1/7th of the total power.  This disparity is explained in the article by the frog's muscle-tendon unit serving as the frog's "catapult" which amplifies muscle output in relation to the elasticity of the tendon and fascia.

Humans produce mechanical work at the ankle joint during walking with an efficiency two to six times greater than isolated muscle efficiency.

[Sawicki et al: It Pays to have Spring in your Step](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821187/)

Human lower limb tendons are better optimized for walking than jumping, yet in gastrocnemius med alone, [the tendon produced between 1-3x the force of the muscle during a maximum vertical jump](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jappl.2001.90.4.1349).  That means the elastic components of the legs account for a much larger portion of the jump than the muscle itself!

### Elastic Power Training

__Elastic Power Training__ refers to the long-term NM adaptation to the speed of a surface that will influence how well your elastic components perform on any given surface.  This is done by increasing the power from muscular coordination and increasing the power from the SSC.  The goal of strong ankles for performance should be to have the largest muscle-tendon unit output rather than just the largest muscular output.  These athletes aim to be extraordinarily springy.

Joel Smith of Just Fly Sports Performance wrote an article on the Massai Warriors who perform a bouncing dance to demonstrate strength and power as a warrior.  Joel describes a "facscially" driven athlete (neural and elastic components) who has never squatted a day in his life.  Basically this is the epitome of elastic power.

Tramp kids can have godly skills on the trampoline but barely be able to to get off the ground in their standing back tucks IF they never adapt to running and jumping on faster surfaces.  Once they get to that point however, their skill on floor can grow exponentially.
