# Pillars of coaching

1. Structure
1. Technical Expertise
1. Class Management
1. Problem Solving

## Structure

systems/methodology influencing macro/meta coaching.

1. gymnastics-style background for developing skills
   1. repeating technical sequences
   1. progression ladders
   1. drill stations
   1. spotting
   1. physicality
1. bondarchuk system
   1. Conjugated by nature
   1. relatively _simple_ workouts that stay the same will save mental energy
   1. [jared's notes on bondarchuk system](https://workflowy.com/s/FjXO.tNsKlXkFfD)
   1. [blurb by jared regarding the bondarchuk system](https://workflowy.com/s/basics-of-the-bondar/iRH2nCKSn7bITqIH)
1. conjugate method (as opposed to orthodox linear periodization)
   1. The name "Conjugate" refers to the simultaneous development of multiple physical qualities (maximal strength, speed-strength, hypertrophy) rather than focusing on one at a time.

## Technical Expertise

1. (micro) skill/intent expertise
   1. what to do, and what not to do in a single movement
1. (macro) what to work on
1. [what is a main quest, what is a side quest?](https://workflowy.com/s/power-tricking/vsLVMKn944RTPyTb)
   1. how things relate to each other
1. (meta) how to change technique
   1. progressions/regressions
   1. at what stage do certain things become important?
      1. working ahead vs "just in time"
1. understanding of form, technique, mechanics

## Class Management

1. use of space
   1. choice of lines, circle, circuit, etc
1. use of time
   1. sections
   1. pacing
   1. transitioning flow between
      1. spaces, sections, into breaks, out of breaks
1. use of resources
   1. mats, walls, lines, partners, spotters, helpers
1. pairings/groupings
   1. is it one person at a time? 2? 3? all?
   1. does it matter how that was determined?
1. motivation & energy
   1. language, tone, actions
1. pre-flight instruction
   1. clear, simple
   1. what to do, what not to do
   1. visual examples
   1. intent
   1. scalable
   1. pre-emptive
   1. safety concerns
1. mid-assignment yapping
   1. reminders of intent or safety concerns
   1. corrections
   1. encouragement
   1. a challenge
1. when to hold the line, when to provide slack

## Problem Solving

1. (micro) what part of the skill or exercise has trouble?
1. (macro) what types of skills and exercise have trouble?
1. (meta) what parts of problem solving is having trouble
1. observational skill
1. on-the-fly thinking
1. review/debrief process
