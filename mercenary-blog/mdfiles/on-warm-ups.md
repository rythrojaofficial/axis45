# Monthly Warm Up

Whether we realise it or not, _every practitioner_ warms up for Tricking, or any similarly difficult activity.

At Axis 45, all our classes have formal monthy warm ups.

`Why Monthly?`

#### Consistency is a streak bonus

It takes lots of reinforcement to build motor patterns and create real change in technique, focus, strength, mobility, balance, control, etc.

1. Stimulate Adaptation (bondarchuck system)
   - but after we plateau, we need a change.
   - There is no such thing as the perfect warm-up
   - We can address long term issues ahead of time by shifting focus, rotating exercises, etc
1. Routine eliminates [decision fatigue and the paradox of choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice)
   - We come in after a long day and before we even decide what to work on, we have to decide what to do to warm up. Let's take care of that ahead of time.
1. Something to look forward to
   - monthly turnover means we won't be bored for long, and if we don't like one, it'll change in a month

#### Opportunity

If you come here twice per week you're getting 8-10 reps of the warm up. I'm here nearly every day, getting 30+ run-throughs.

If you do something 6+ times, you tend to get better at it. Each month's warm up is an opportunity to get _significantly_ better at something.

Whehter it's balance, hip rotation, muscle activation or some sort of arm/body rhythm, you can influence an outcome by design.

`Generally speaking, what is a warm up in the context of sport?`

> _From google:_
>
> ### Purpose:
>
> Warming up helps the body gradually transition from a resting state to one of increased activity. This involves increasing the heart rate, blood flow to muscles, and raising the overall body temperature.
>
> ### Benefits:
>
> **Reduced risk of injury**: When muscles are warmed up, they are more pliable and less prone to strains or tears.
>
> **Improved performance**: Increased blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to muscles, leading to better performance and reduced fatigue.
>
> **Enhanced efficiency**: Warming up allows the body to function more efficiently during the activity.
>
> ### Types of warm-up exercises:
>
> Warm-ups can include dynamic stretches, light cardio, and specific exercises that mimic the movements of the sport. For example, a basketball player might warm up with some jogging, dribbling drills, and shooting practice.
>
> **Importance of specificity**:
> The warm-up should be tailored to the specific sport or activity to ensure that the muscles and joints most involved are properly prepared.
