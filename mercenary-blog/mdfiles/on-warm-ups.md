# Axis 45 Monthly Warm ups

`What's the point of A45 Monthly Warm Ups?`

> **To efficiently and effectively serve the purpose of a general warm up**
>
> while learning or reinforcing important movement patterns,
>
> stimulating planned adaptations through consistent practice,
>
> and fostering community through alignment and continuity.

`Generally speaking, what is a warm up in the context of sport?`

> _From google:_
>
> ### Purpose:
>
> Warming up helps the body gradually transition from a resting state to one of increased activity. This involves increasing the heart rate, blood flow to muscles, and raising the overall body temperature.
>
> ### Benefits:
>
> **Reduced risk of injury**: When muscles are warmed up, they are more pliable and less prone to strains or tears.
>
> **Improved performance**: Increased blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to muscles, leading to better performance and reduced fatigue.
>
> **Enhanced efficiency**: Warming up allows the body to function more efficiently during the activity.
>
> ### Types of warm-up exercises:
>
> Warm-ups can include dynamic stretches, light cardio, and specific exercises that mimic the movements of the sport. For example, a basketball player might warm up with some jogging, dribbling drills, and shooting practice.
>
> **Importance of specificity**:
> The warm-up should be tailored to the specific sport or activity to ensure that the muscles and joints most involved are properly prepared.

# Monthly Warm Up

Whether they realise it or not, _every practitioner_ warms up for Tricking, or any similarly difficult activity.

Some warm-ups are more effective than others, and some warm-ups are more useful than others.

Many teen and early adult trickers do a few leg swings, spend 10 seconds in a pancake stretch, then start throwing tricks.

You can get away with a lot by skipping most things, but there are only benefits to be had by implementing an effictive, targeted warm up.

At Axis 45, our classes have formal monthy warm ups.

`Why Monthly?`

#### Consistency is a streak bonus

It takes lots of reinforcement to build motor patterns and create real change in technique, focus, strength, mobility, balance, control, etc.

1. Stimulate Adaptation (bondarchuck system)
   - There is no such thing as the perfect warm-up
   - We can address long term issues ahead of time by shifting focus, rotating exercises, etc
   - but after we plateau, we need a change.
1. Routine eliminates [decision fatigue and the paradox of choice](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice)
   - We come in after a long day and before we even decide what to work on, we have to decide what to do to warm up. We can take care of that ahead of time by providing the monthly warm-up.
1. Something to look forward to
   - monthly turnover means we won't be bored for long, and if we don't like one, it'll change in a month

#### Opportunity

If you come here twice per week you're getting 8-10 reps of the warm up. I'm here nearly every day, getting 30+ run-throughs monthly.

If you do something 6+ times, you tend to get better at it. Each month's warm up is an opportunity to get _significantly_ better at something.

Whether it's balance, hip rotation, muscle activation or some sort of arm/body rhythm, you can influence an outcome by design.

#### Alignment & Continuity

No matter what day you're here, there will likely be someone who has done or will be doing the same warm-up you're doing. That keeps all our groups aligned in a way that fosters community.

If someone is graduating from thursdays to tuesdays or fridays, there is continuity with hopefully a smooth and easy integration

`Why themed?`

#### There's a lot to be learned from other sports

1. Cross training
1. Movement literacy
1. Getting out of your comfort zone
1. Being bad at something fosters [white belt mentality](https://www.wrestlingmindset.com/blog/white-belt-mentality-2)
1. Connecting the dots on how movement patterns are similar and different and why
1. learning is fun and it's super low commitment
   - it's just a warm up, you're not literally training to be a ballet dancer, wrestler, muay thai fighter, etc
1. Doing things differently gets you out of your dogma
1. forces creativity on the part of the Warm-up planner

`Key components`

_in no particular order:_

1. muscle activation
1. balance
1. passive, active, dynamic, ballistic movements
1. rhythm
1. coordination movements
1. isolation movements
1. jumping, bouncing, hopping
1. rotation with arms, rotation with hips
1. mobility, and strength specifically with pain points for trickers
   - hips internal/exeternal
   - neck
   - shoulders
   - achilles/ankles
   - low, mid, upper back
   - side bending, back bending, forward bending
   - glute, hip flexor, piriformis
   - adductors/abductors
1. skill-specific movements

`Meta components`

1. efficiency
   - try not to have wasted, filler items
   - duplicate items should be heavily considered
1. flow
   - Consider how one item moves to the next.
   - it should naturally move from one thing to the next
1. structure
   - separate portions of the warm up naturally (look at previous warm up examples)
1. theme
   - have something to anchor your warm up into a storyline rather than a collection of stuff you've seen on instagram
1. scalable yet challenging. Too easy or too hard result in lack of engagement
1. synergy with tuesday exercise
