# On Breath and Bottles

This past month my students have been working on a concept known to martial artists as **kiai**

> ### What is Kiai?
>
> Breaking down the word, ki means energy and ai means to harmonize. Put together, kiai means to focus or direct your energy. This energy can be released in a shout or can be silent.
>
> ### How to Find Your Kiai
>
> Kiai comes from the diaphragm - the same muscle that you use to cough. Try coughing and take note of where you feel the muscle contract in your stomach. Get used to this feeling and try adding a sound instead of a cough.
