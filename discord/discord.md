You can easily stay up to date on what's happening through our [homepage](https://www.seattletricking.com) or the [@seattletricking instagram](https://www.instagram.com/seattletricking/)

#### So why join our Discord?

- **Notifications**
  - Never miss an update for meet-ups, events, news, or closures due to not checking the website or instagram.
- **Chats**
  1.  Be part of the community on your usual Axis days.
      - Whether you're part of the Thursday Tribe, Sunday Squad, Tuesday Crew, or an Open session guy/gal, stay in the know!
  2.  Be part of the general Seattle Tricking Community.
      - Every day at Axis is it's own ecosystem, but we're all Seattle Tricklers\*!
      - We also do things outside of gym and even tricking ðŸ˜‰

###### \*Tricklers is an inside joke: ESPN once broadcasted the Adrenaline games as Martial Arts Trickling (instead of Tricking) on live TV

### Filter Channels

By [default](#enable-chats), you will get only @mentions that you filter into upon joining our discord.

You can also change this at any time by navigating to **channels and roles** on the top left!
